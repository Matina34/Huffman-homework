# Huffman Coding – Homework

This project implements **Huffman coding**, a lossless data compression algorithm.

## What is implemented

- Character frequency computation  
- Huffman tree construction using a min-heap  
- Extraction of Huffman codes  
- Text encoding and decoding  
- Universal Huffman tree based on English character frequencies  
- Comparison between Huffman encoding and ASCII (8 bits per character)
